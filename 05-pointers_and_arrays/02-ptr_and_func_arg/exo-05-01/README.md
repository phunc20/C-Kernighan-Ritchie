In case you yourself, at a second or later reading of the description of this exercise, fail to grasp its meaning right away:<br>
It actually describes a simple problem of the code of `getint()`, which is, when the input is sth like `"-a"` or `"     +%!@#$%"`, the code will take
them as `0` and `*pn` will be `0`. We are asked to improve on this.
